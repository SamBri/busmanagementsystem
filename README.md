# Bus Management System
Bus management system with receipt generation.

# problem statement.doc
green indicates successful.

red indicates not clear per the current implementation.

blue indicates user should attempt the questions.

# Locate File
Executable file(busmanagementsystem.exe) found under bin/Debug.    

Receipt generate and displays after code execution.

Location of receipt.txt can change based on target folder selected, Debug or Release when compiling.

Default target is Debug.

Code can also be compiled by running main.cpp on any c++ compiler.

# Note
data structures such as trees,heaps, linkedlist, queues were not used as the problem statement does indicate so so as the questions esp 2.

second question shades the current implementation for an advanced system hence the second question leads to another build.
